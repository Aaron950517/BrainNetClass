dHOFC method is used to constructed the brain network.

Step size is 1. 
Number of clusters ranges in 100  200  300. 
Window length ranges in 20  30. 

Using local clustering coefficients as features and lasso(lambda=0.1) for feature selection.

Using leave-one-out cross validation to calculate the final results.
The suggested parameter(s): 20  200. 

The occurrence of hyper-parameter(s):
20,100 							 20%
30,100 							 10%
20,200 							 55%
20,300 							 5%
30,300 							 10%
