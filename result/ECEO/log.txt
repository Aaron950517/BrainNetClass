SGR method is used to constructed the brain network.

Lambda 1 ranges in 0.01        0.02        0.03        0.04        0.05        0.06        0.07        0.08        0.09         0.1.
Lambda 2 ranges in 0.01        0.02        0.03        0.04        0.05        0.06        0.07        0.08        0.09         0.1.
Lambda 1 controls the sparsity and lambda 2 controls the group sparsity.

Using connection coefficients as features and ttest (p<0.05) + LASSO (lambda=0.01) for feature selection.

Using leave-one-out cross validation to calculate the final results.

The suggested parameter(s): 0.09        0.03.
