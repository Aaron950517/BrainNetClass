dHOFC method is used to constructed the brain network.
step length is 1 
cluster ranges in 800  900 
window_length ranges in 40  50  60 
Using weighted-graph local clustering coefficients as features and lasso(lambda=5.000000e-02) for feature selection
Using 10-fold to calculate the final results
The 10-fold cross valindation was repeated 5 times 
The optimal parameter(s):800   40
