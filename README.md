# BrainNetClass
The aim of this toolbox is to make it easier for neuroscientists and clinicians to conduct state-of-the-art brain network 
construction and rigorous machine learning-based classifications.
  
## Requirements
  
  * SLEP
  * Libsvm
 
 These two toolboxes are included in the repository but may need to be complied in your own computer.
 
 ## Example Dataset
  
The repository provides a usage example on the eyes closed/eyes open dataset. 
The goal is to use resting-state fMRI time series from 116 brain regions to construct brain functional networks 
and predict whether the subject is in eyes closed state or eyes open state. 
There is a full version (with longer running time but better classification result) and 
a simplified version of the data (with shorter running time, for fast running).
